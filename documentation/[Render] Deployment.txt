[Render] Git and GitHub Setup

Render will run build scripts and deploy your application to remote servers 
whenever you push code to a GitHub repository you connect to it. 
So, the first step we need to do is to create this repository.

1. Install the local Git CLI tools.
macOS:
Run the following command in your terminal:
xcode-select --install
If this command results in an error, 
you may need to install the full version of XCode from the macOS AppStore.


2. Create GitHub Repository
https://github.com/new

3. Local Git Repo Setup
Next, we need to run some local Git commands to get our code into the repository. 
Use your preferred terminal application to navigate to your project directory. 
Run the following commands inside of the project root (where your package.json file is)
Copy-paste the commands from the â€¦or create a new repository on the command line section of the your GitHub repo:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://YOUR_GITHUB_URL.git
git push -u origin main

4. Verify Deployment

After the git push command from the last step, your code should now be deployed and visible in the newly created GitHub repository.
