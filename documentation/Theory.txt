Prepare project
1. npm init
2.a install express: npm install --save express
2.b verify installation : cat package.json -> check express in "dependencies" section
3. run server: npm index.js (it's available on localhost:port_number - the one that you've made express listen to)


Sidenotes
Node: JS runtime used to execute the code outside of the browser
Express: library that runs in Node runtime. Has helpers methods to deal with HTTP traffic easier


NodeJS server - listens to HTTP traffic on some specific port (like 5000).
If some app (like Express) is bounded to the same port, Node then passes incoming requests to that app.
Looking into request, Express then decides which method of the application can handle the request
(somehow respond to this incoming request)
In Express we write collection of route handlers which are the link between URL+parameters of the request
and application methods, for example.
Route 1: authentication
Route 2: create & save new Survey/Campaign entity
Route 3: provide admin entrypoint

Node relies on common.js modules - system of import between the modules (const express = require('express'))
React uses system of import ES2018 (import express from "express";)
