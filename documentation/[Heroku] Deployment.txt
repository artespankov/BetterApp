Checklist

1st time

1. Dynamic port binding - bind express to port
 assigned by heroku to deployed application
 (using process.env.PORT)
2. Specify Node runtime - tell Heroku which version of Node we'd like to use (package.json/engines section)
3. Specify start script - instruct Heroku what command to run to start the server (package.json/scripts section)
4. Add .gitignore - dont include dependencies in deployment as Heroku will do that
