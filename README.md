# Why this World needs the BetterApp?
TL;DR: BetterApp is aimed to make our apps, well, better through collecting user testimonials with fast & easy bulk emails. 
Target audience - owners and product managers of startups/small companies/indie game makers/bloggers & influencers/~~cryto enthusiasts~~


---
As an owner of a product once you've created, debugged, deployed & polished your application,
you'd like to keep an eye on how's your application doing rather than leave it alone dealing with the challenges in a wild

With game & mobile applications distributed via some centralised middleware, like Steam, Play market or App store -
numbers like new installations, ratings provided along with user feedback, which you can use then to learn from and reiterate your product, - are all collectd by marketplace and available to you in just a click


With web applications things are a bit trickier, you can always enable some metrics
to share with your marketing department with tools like Google Analytics,
but when it comes to user feedback - the good old "Contacts" section is your friend. 
It can be as simple as support email or phone (if you find your life is too boring)
placed in the footer, link to community in discord or telegram, or some variation of the contact form

But what if you'd like to be more proactive (and carry a little about the personal space), - 
then you can take initiative and craft an email to be sent to all you customers, something like
"Hey, that would be great if you can share some feedback, so I can understand better how you use the app 
and whether you enjoy it or not". 

Then with some tools on the market you can categorise user responses and use this info for the next version of your app:
the better, safer, and, for sure, - more popular.  

My app will help you automate your way of collecting the insights for the best version of your app*

(*) Except of the categorisation step, which is much better handled by Neuro-nets than any other tools nowadays. 
So maybe(!) I'll train one to deal with that as well, so watch out for my following projects - ~~subscribe for YouTube channel~~ don't forget to follow my GitHub
